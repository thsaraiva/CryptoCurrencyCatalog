- Create RecyclerView Adapter and View Holder ✅
- Set Adapter and LayoutManager in RecyclerView ✅

## Read Currencies from local JSON file

## Write UI Tests for recycler view
- test 1st element is visible
- test element that is hidden is visible after scrolling

## Search Specific Currency
- Search icon on ActionBar
- Use SearchView component

## Use Koin as DependencyInjection framework
